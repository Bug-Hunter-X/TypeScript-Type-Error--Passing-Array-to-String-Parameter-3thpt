This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error. The file 'bug.ts' contains code that attempts to pass an array to a function expecting a string, resulting in a type error.  The solution, provided in 'bugSolution.ts', addresses this by modifying the function's parameter type or the argument passed to match the function's expected input.
